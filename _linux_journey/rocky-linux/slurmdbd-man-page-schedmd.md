NAME
slurmdbd - Slurm Database Daemon.

 
SYNOPSIS
slurmdbd [OPTIONS...]

 
DESCRIPTION
slurmdbd provides a secure enterprise-wide interface to a database for Slurm. This is particularly useful for archiving accounting records.

 
OPTIONS

-D
    Run slurmdbd in the foreground with logging copied to stdout. 

-h
    Help; print a brief summary of command options. 

-n <value>
    Set the daemon's nice value to the specified value, typically a negative number. 

-s
    Change working directory of slurmdbd to LogFile path if possible, or to /var/tmp otherwise. 

-u
    Only display the Slurm Database version and if conversion is needed and exit without taking control. If no conversion is needed 0 is returned, if conversion is needed 1 is returned. 

-v
    Verbose operation. Multiple v's can be specified, with each 'v' beyond the first increasing verbosity, up to 6 times (i.e. -vvvvvv). 

-V
    Print version information and exit. 

 
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables can be used to override settings compiled into slurmdbd.

ABORT_ON_FATAL
    When a fatal error is detected, use abort() instead of exit() to terminate the process. This allows backtraces to be captured without recompiling Slurm. 

 
CORE FILE LOCATION
If slurmdbd is started with the -D option then the core file will be written to the current working directory. Otherwise if LogFile in "slurmdbd.conf" is a fully qualified path name (starting with a slash), the core file will be written to the same directory as the log file, provided SlurmUser has write permission on the directory. Otherwise the core file will be written to "/var/tmp/" as a last resort. If neither of the above directories have write permission for SlurmUser, no core file will be produced.

 
SIGNALS

SIGTERM SIGINT SIGQUIT
    slurmdbd will shutdown cleanly, waiting for in-progress rollups to finish. 

SIGABRT
    slurmdbd will perform a core dump, then exit. In-progress operations are killed. 

SIGHUP
    Reloads the slurm configuration files, similar to 'scontrol reconfigure'. 

SIGTSTP
    Stop the process from a terminal. 

SIGUSR2
    Reread the log level from the configs, and then reopen the log file. This should be used when setting up logrotate(8). 

SIGCHLD SIGUSR1 SIGXCPU SIGPIPE SIGALRM
    These signals are explicitly ignored. 

 
NOTES
It may be useful to experiment with different slurmctld specific configuration parameters using a distinct configuration file (e.g. timeouts). However, this special configuration file will not be used by the slurmd daemon or the Slurm programs, unless you specifically tell each of them to use it. If you desire changing communication ports, the location of the temporary file system, or other parameters used by other Slurm components, change the common configuration file, slurm.conf.
