# Control Plane Failure - Solution

* The Cluster is broken:

```
Run the command: kubectl get pods -n kube-system and check the status of kube-scheduler pod.
We need to check the kube-scheduler manifest file to fix the issue.

spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-scheduler
    - --authentication-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
    - --authorization-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
    - --bind-address=127.0.0.1
    - --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
    - --leader-elect=true
    ....

Once this is corrected, the scheduler pod will be recreated
```

* Scale the deployment app to 2 pods.

```
Run the command: kubectl scale deploy app --replicas=2
```

* Even though the deployment was scaled to 2, the number of PODs does not seem to increase. Investigate and fix the issue. Inspect the component responsible for managing deployments and replicasets.

```
Run the command: kubectl get po -n kube-system and check the logs of kube-controller-manager pod to know the failure reason by running command: kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-controlplane

Then check the kube-controller-manager configuration file at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml and fix the issue.

root@controlplane:/etc/kubernetes/manifests# kubectl -n kube-system logs kube-controller-manager-controlplane
I0916 13:10:47.059336       1 serving.go:348] Generated self-signed cert in-memory
stat /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager-XXXX.conf: no such file or directory

root@controlplane:/etc/kubernetes/manifests# 

The configuration file specified (/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager-XXXX.conf) does not exist.
Correct the path: /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
```

* Something is wrong with scaling again. We just tried scaling the deployment to 3 replicas. But it's not happening.

```
Check the volume mount path in kube-controller-manager manifest file at /etc/kubernetes/manifests.
Just as we did in the previous question, inspect the logs of the kube-controller-manager pod:

root@controlplane:/etc/kubernetes/manifests# kubectl -n kube-system logs kube-controller-manager-controlplane
I0916 13:17:27.452539       1 serving.go:348] Generated self-signed cert in-memory
unable to load client CA provider: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt: no such file or directory

root@controlplane:/etc/kubernetes/manifests# 

It appears the path /etc/kubernetes/pki is not mounted from the controlplane to the kube-controller-manager pod. If we inspect the pod manifest file, we can see that the incorrect hostPath is used for the volume:

WRONG:

- hostPath:
      path: /etc/kubernetes/WRONG-PKI-DIRECTORY
      type: DirectoryOrCreate

CORRECT:

- hostPath: 
    path: /etc/kubernetes/pki 
    type: DirectoryOrCreate 

Once the path is corrected, the pod will be recreated and our deployment should eventually scale up to 3 replicas.
```
