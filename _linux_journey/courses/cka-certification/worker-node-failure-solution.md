# Worker Node Failure - Solution

* Fix the broken cluster:

```
Step1: Check the status of the nodes:

controlplane:~> kubectl get nodes
NAME           STATUS     ROLES           AGE   VERSION
controlplane   Ready      control-plane   19m   v1.27.0
node01         NotReady   <none>          19m   v1.27.0

controlplane:~> 

Step 2: SSH to node01 and check the status of the container runtime (containerd, in this case) and the kubelet service.

root@node01:~> systemctl status containerd
● containerd.service - containerd container runtime
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/containerd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Tue 2023-05-30 12:45:03 EDT; 20min ago
       Docs: https://containerd.io
   Main PID: 995 (containerd)
      Tasks: 100
     Memory: 146.8M
     CGroup: /system.slice/containerd.service
             ├─ 995 /usr/bin/containerd

root@node01:~>

root@node01:~> systemctl status kubelet
● kubelet.service - kubelet: The Kubernetes Node Agent
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
             └─10-kubeadm.conf
     Active: inactive (dead) since Tue 2023-05-30 12:47:30 EDT; 18min ago
       Docs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/
    Process: 1978 ExecStart=/usr/bin/kubelet $KUBELET_KUBECONFIG_ARGS $KUBELET_CONFIG_ARGS $KUBELET_KUBEADM_ARGS $KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS (code=exited, status=0/S>
   Main PID: 1978 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

Since the kubelet is not running, attempt to start it by running the following command:

root@node01:~> systemctl start kubelet

root@node01:~> systemctl status kubelet
● kubelet.service - kubelet: The Kubernetes Node Agent
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
             └─10-kubeadm.conf
     Active: active (running) since Tue 2023-05-30 13:06:47 EDT; 6s ago
       Docs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/
   Main PID: 4313 (kubelet)
      Tasks: 15 (limit: 77091)
     Memory: 31.4M
     CGroup: /system.slice/kubelet.service

node01 should go back to ready state now.
```

* The cluster is broken again, fix the issue:

```
kubelet has stopped running on node01 again. Since this is a systemd managed system, we can check the kubelet log by running journalctl command. Here is a snippet showing the error with kubelet:

root@node01:~# journalctl -u kubelet 
.
.
May 30 13:08:20 node01 kubelet[4554]: E0530 13:08:20.141826    4554 run.go:74] "command failed" err="failed to construct kubelet dependencies: unable to load client CA file /etc/kubernetes/pki/WRONG-CA-FILE.crt: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/WRONG-CA-FILE.crt: no such file or directory"
.
.


There appears to be a mistake path used for the CA certificate in the kubelet configuration.

This can be corrected by updating the file /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml as follows: -

  x509:
    clientCAFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/WRONG-CA-FILE.crt


Update the CA certificate file WRONG-CA-FILE.crt to ca.crt.

Once this is fixed, restart the kubelet service, (like we did in the previous question) and node01 should return back to a working state.
```

* The cluster is broken yet blooming again:

```
Once again the kubelet service has stopped working. Checking the logs, we can see that this time, it is not able to reach the kube-apiserver.


root@node01:~# journalctl -u kubelet 
.
.
.
May 30 13:43:55 node01 kubelet[8858]: E0530 13:43:55.004939    8858 reflector.go:148] vendor/k8s.io/client-go/informers/factory.go:150: Failed to watch *v1.Node: failed to list *v1.Node: Get "https://controlplane:6553/api/v1/nodes?fieldSelector=metadata.name%3Dnode01&limit=500&resourceVersion=0": dial tcp 192.24.132.5:6553: connect: connection refused
.
.
.


As we can clearly see, kubelet is trying to connect to the API server on the controlplane node on port 6553. This is incorrect.
To fix, correct the port on the kubeconfig file used by the kubelet.

apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data:
    --REDACTED---
    server: https://controlplane:6443


Restart the kubelet service after this change.

systemctl restart kubelet
```
